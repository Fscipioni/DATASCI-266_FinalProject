## Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between
audience reactions and news headlines on Face-
book, focusing on the platform’s “Reactions”
feature, which offers nuanced emotional re-
sponses beyond the traditional “Like.” By de-
veloping a novel sentiment scoring system for
Facebook Reactions and employing a hybrid
model combining transformers and convolu-
tional neural networks, we analyzed the senti-
ment elicited by headlines from 16 prominent
U.S. news outlets.
Our methodology includes deriving sentiment
scores for reactions, recalibrating neutral sen-
timent classifications, and categorizing head-
lines into binary and multiclass sentiment la-
bels. The results reveal significant trends in
headline framing across outlets, highlighting
the prevalence of neutral to negative sentiments
and variations in emotional engagement. Mod-
eling efforts demonstrate the complexity of ac-
curately predicting audience sentiment, with a
BERT-CNN hybrid achieving the highest accu-
racy at 71% for binary classification and 55%
for multiclass classification.
Our findings underscore how editorial fram-
ing and language choices influence audience
sentiment, revealing potential biases and emo-
tional undercurrents in digital news dissemina-
tion. This research contributes to responsible
headline crafting by offering insights into the
interplay between news media strategies and
public emotional responses, with implications
for promoting balanced discourse in the digital
age.
